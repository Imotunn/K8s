# Kubernetes for Beginners

_Based on a workshop originally written by [Jérôme Petazzoni](http://container.training/) with contributions from [many others](https://github.com/jpetazzo/container.training/graphs/contributors)_

## Introduction

In this hands-on workshop, you will learn the basic concepts of Kubernetes. You will do that through interacting with Kubernetes through the command line terminals on the right. Ultimately you will deploy the sample applications [Dockercoins](https://github.com/dockersamples/dockercoins) on both worker nodes.

## Getting Started

### What are these terminals in the browsers?

For this introductory labs we will be using hosted terminal, provided by [Play with Kubernetes](https://labs.play-with-k8s.com/). You may be asked to login first, which you can do with your [GitHub](https://github.com/) account. Those terminals are fully functional terminals running Centos. Actually, they're the commandline for Centos containers running on our Play-with-Kubernetes infrastructure. When you see code blocks that look like this, you can either click on them and they will auto populate, or your can copy and paste them.

### The pabs material
The material is provided via a [PDF document](Kubernetes%20for%20Beginners.pdf). Follow the instructions.
